# Fan Control for Nvidia gpus on linux
This is a simple program for autonomously altering the fan speed of nvidia cards on linux. 

### Why did you create this?
On EthOS they only let you set a default speed, I wanted my fans to respond to their reported temperatures.

### Programs that need to be installed for this to work
- nvidia-settings
- nvidia-smi
